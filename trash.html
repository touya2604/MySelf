    <h3>Lyrics</h3>
    <pre>
        This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
        No silent prayer for faith-departed
        I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
        You're gonna hear my voice
        When I shout it out loud

        It's my life
        It's now or never
        I ain't gonna live forever
        I just want to live while I'm alive
        (It's my life)
        My heart is like an open highway
        Like Frankie said
        I did it my way
        I just wanna live while I'm alive
        It's my life

        This is for the ones who stood their ground
        For Tommy and Gina, never backed down
        Tomorrow's getting hard make no mistake
        Luck ain't even lucky
        Got to make your owns breaks

        It's my life
        It's now or never
        I ain't gonna live forever
        I just want to live while I'm alive
        (It's my life)
        My heart is like an open highway
        Like Frankie said
        I did it my way
        I just wanna live while I'm alive
        It's my life

        Better stand tall when they're calling you out
        Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down

        It's my life
        It's now or never
        I ain't gonna live forever
        I just want to live while I'm alive
        (It's my life)
        My heart is like an open highway
        Like Frankie said
        I did it my way
        I just wanna live while I'm alive
        It's my life

        It's now or never
        I ain't gonna live forever
        I just want to live while I'm alive
        (It's my life)
        My heart is like an open highway
        Like Frankie said
        I did it my way
        I just wanna live while I'm alive
        It's my life
